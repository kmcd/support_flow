Rails 4 support

The master branch is now on Rails 4.2. However, there is a Rails 3.2 branch available if you still need to use it. Please note that subsequent gem releases will focus on Rails 4 (v0.14.0+ as yet unreleased).
Important security note

Please note that several severe vulnerabilities have been fixed recently. You should upgrade to the most recent 0.13.x version or higher. See the security vulnerabilities page for more details.
System Requirements

    Ruby 2 (2.2 recommended)
        Ruby 1.9.3 is no longer compatible (final gem release tag v0.13.6)
        Ruby v1.8.7 was supported until v0.11.4 (see https://github.com/fatfreecrm/fat_free_crm/tree/ruby1.8)
    MySQL v4.1.1 or later (v5+ is recommended), SQLite v3.4 or later, or Postgres 8.4.8 or later.
    ImageMagick (optional, only needed if you would like to use avatars)

(Ruby on Rails and other gem dependencies will be installed automatically by Bundler.)
Installation

Please view one of the following installation guides:
Setup Linux or Mac OS

Installing Fat Free CRM on Linux or Mac OS X
Setup Heroku

Setting up a Heroku instance for Fat Free CRM
Setup Microsoft Windows

Installing Fat Free CRM on Microsoft Windows
Running Fat Free CRM as a Rails Engine

Run the Fat Free CRM gem within a separate Rails application. This is the best way to deploy Fat Free CRM if you need to add plugins or make any customizations. Note that it is not yet simple to 'bolt' Fat Free CRM into your existing rails project, but we're heading in that direction.
Upgrading from previous versions of Fat Free CRM

Please read the Release Notes document for more detailed information on upgrading from previous versions.

For Developers

Fat Free CRM is released under the MIT license and is freely available for you to use for your own purposes. We do encourage contributions to make Fat Free CRM even better. Send us a pull-request and we'll do our best to accommodate your needs.

Specific features that are not 'Fat Free' in nature, can be added by creating Rails Engines. See the wiki for information on how to do this.

Tests can easily be run by typing 'rake' but please note that they do take a while to run! Alternatively, you can see the test build status over at our travis page
